To run this do composer update

then cd to projectDIR/public

then type the following

php index.php users fetchusers

for downloading the users this is a console command

php index.php users query "age" "20"

or 

php index.php users query "age" "20" false

Each space is a new parameter so we have field value exact. 

Exact is referenced as a string as that is what is being passed a string value.

To run the report

php index.php users report
